In high school, Stephen lived in Taipei as an exchange student; ever since, he has been writing about his time in Taipei, his experience\\'s learning Mandarin, and his interest in organizations. Stephen\\'s work has appeared in the Harvard Business Review, Slate, and has been cited by Hillary Clinton in speeches. Stephen currently works for McKinsey & Company where he tries to combine data science with questions about human and organizational behavior. In his free time, Stephen studies languages.
